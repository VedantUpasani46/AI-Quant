Transformers & Multi-Modal Learning for Finance
================================================
Target: IC 0.25+ | Multi-Modal Fusion |

This module implements Transformer models and multi-modal learning that
combines price data, text, and alternative data for superior predictions.

Why Transformers Beat LSTMs:
  - PARALLEL PROCESSING: Train 10x faster than LSTM
  - LONG-RANGE DEPENDENCIES: Capture patterns across 100+ days
  - ATTENTION: Learn what matters (earnings > random days)
  - MULTI-MODAL: Naturally fuse different data types
  - STATE-OF-ART: Best performance on complex tasks

Target: IC 0.25+, combine multiple data sources

Mathematical Foundation:
------------------------
Transformer Self-Attention:
  Q = XW_Q, K = XW_K, V = XW_V
  Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k) · V
  
  Learns which past timesteps are most relevant

Multi-Head Attention:
  MultiHead(Q,K,V) = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h) · W_O
  where head_i = Attention(QW_Q^i, KW_K^i, VW_V^i)
  
  Multiple attention patterns (short-term + long-term)

Cross-Modal Attention:
  Q from modality A, K and V from modality B
  Allows price encoder to attend to news encoder

1. TRANSFORMER vs LSTM:
   
   **Advantages**:
   ✅ Parallel processing (10x faster training)
   ✅ Long-range dependencies (attend to any past day)
   ✅ Interpretable (attention weights show importance)
   ✅ Flexible (easy to add new data modalities)
   
   **Disadvantages**:
   ❌ More parameters (needs more data)
   ❌ Less inductive bias (LSTM knows time flows forward)
   ❌ Quadratic complexity in sequence length
   
   **In practice**: Transformer usually better for finance when:
   • Lots of data (5+ years)
   • Long sequences (60+ days)
   • Multi-modal inputs

2. MULTI-MODAL LEARNING VALUE:
   Price IC: {price_ic:.3f}
   Text IC: {text_ic:.3f}
   AltData IC: {alt_ic:.3f}
   Combined IC: {combined_ic:.3f}
   
   → Combined > Individual (synergy effect)
   → Different modalities capture different information
   → Price = what happened, Text = why, AltData = what's happening now
   → Fusion is key: Learn how modalities interact

3. REAL-WORLD MULTI-MODAL EXAMPLES:
   
   **Example 1**: Retail stock (Target)
   • Price: Momentum +5% (bullish)
   • Satellite: Parking lots +15% vs last year (bullish)
   • Text: News sentiment +0.7 (positive earnings preview)
   → Combined signal: STRONG BUY (all align)
   
   **Example 2**: Tech stock (Meta)
   • Price: Momentum -10% (bearish)
   • Alt: App downloads +20% (bullish - contradicts price)
   • Text: Negative news on regulation (bearish)
   → Combined signal: NEUTRAL (mixed signals, wait)
   
   Model learns: When modalities disagree, confidence is lower

4. PRODUCTION ARCHITECTURE:
   
   **Data pipeline**:
   Price data (Polygon) → Price encoder (Transformer)
                           ↓
   News (Bloomberg) → Text encoder (BERT) → Fusion layer → Prediction
                           ↓
   Satellite (Planet) → Image encoder (CNN)
   
   **Infrastructure cost**:
   • Data: $500K/year (Bloomberg + Planet + Polygon)
   • Compute: $200K/year (GPU cluster for training)
   • Engineering: 3 engineers @ $500K = $1.5M/year
   • Total: $2.2M/year
   
   **Return**: If IC 0.25 on $500M AUM → $50M+ profit
   → ROI: 20x (worth it!)

5. CHALLENGES IN PRODUCTION:
   
   **Data alignment**: Price = real-time, News = delayed, Satellite = daily
   → Need careful timestamp alignment
   → Missing data handling (not all stocks have satellite coverage)
   
   **Model staleness**: Markets evolve, model degrades
   → Retrain monthly (expensive: 48 hours GPU time)
   → Monitor IC daily, retrain if drops >20%
   
   **Latency**: Multi-modal models are SLOW
   → Price encoder: 10ms
   → Text encoder: 50ms (BERT)
   → Image encoder: 100ms (CNN)
   → Total: 160ms (acceptable for daily predictions, not HFT)
